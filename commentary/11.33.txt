Tasmat, therefore; tvam, you; uttistha, rise up; (and) labhasva, gain; the yasah, fame, that Arjuna has conquered the Atirathas [Atiratha-see note under 1.4.6.-Tr.], Bhisma, Drona and others, who are unconquerable even by the gods. Such fame can be acquired only by virtuous actions. Jitva, by defeating; satrun, the enemies, Duryodhana and others; bhunksva, enjoy; a rajyam, kingdom; that is samrddham, propersous, free from enemies and obstacles. Ete, these; nihatah, have been definitely killed, made lifeless; eva maya, verily by Me; eva purvam, even earlier. Bhava, be you; nimitta-matram, merely an instrument, O Savyasachin. Arjuna was called so because he could shoot arrows even with his left hand.
